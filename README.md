#Taviraj Font

Taviraj is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensure readability and legibility. It is well-suited for formal usage. Thai letters have thick and thin stroke, as similar to Latin, together with its rounded and airy looped terminal. Taviraj was expanded into a 9 weight family including italic version. 

Taviraj is a word that refers to The last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. People also metaphorically refers Taviraj to the fall of dynasty and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation that Siam being threatened by France expansionism as his majesty expressing his sorrowful towards possibility of the end of his era. However, the fact that traditional Thai font is called "farangses" which means France, Taviraj is also in this genre, is full of contradictory per se and is worth discussing about its origin.
